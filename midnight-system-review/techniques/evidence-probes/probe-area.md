## Capability

Execute the planned probes for one investigation area — source tracing, code-graph queries, metadata comparison, or runtime/SCALE checks per the [probe-catalog](../../resources/probe-catalog.md) — within the probe budget, degrading gracefully where a toolchain gate is false, and emit the area's evidence record.

## Inputs

### current_area

The investigation area for this iteration — its `planned_probes`, `subsystems`, and `changed_files` drive probe execution.

### gitnexus_available

Routes code-graph probes: true routes through the meta `gitnexus-operations` group (`query`, `context`, `impact`, `diff-coverage-map`); false degrades them to grep and full-file reads.

### cargo_available

Gates build and metadata probes; false records them as blocked validations.

### node_binary_available

Gates runtime and SCALE-metadata probes; false records them as blocked validations.

## Outputs

### area_evidence_collection

The gathered collection of per-area evidence records — this iteration appends its record in area order. Each record carries:

#### area_id

The area this record belongs to.

#### probes_executed

Each executed probe: catalog entry, instrument used (capability path or fallback), and outcome.

#### evidence_items

Concrete observations with anchors — file:line references, command output, or graph query results.

#### blocked_validations

Probes that could not run because a toolchain gate is false — the probe, the missing instrument, and what it would have validated.

#### candidate_findings

Preliminary issue candidates surfaced by this area's evidence, with their supporting anchors, for adjudication.

## Protocol

### 1. Execute Probes

- Execute `{current_area}.planned_probes` in plan order, at most `{probe_budget_per_area}` probes; the budget is a hard stop, not a target — stop early once the area's planned validations are answered.
- Route each probe by its catalog class: code-graph probes through `gitnexus-operations` when `{gitnexus_available}` is true, otherwise grep and full-file reads; build/metadata probes only when `{cargo_available}` is true; runtime and SCALE-metadata probes only when `{node_binary_available}` is true. Cross-record correlation questions run as P7 (source trace of each join-key to its origin); downstream-caller failure-atomicity questions run as P8 (caller enumeration via `gitnexus-operations` when available, else grep and reads, then tracing each caller's state mutation around the fallible call).
- Record a blocked validation for every probe whose gate is false — what could not be validated and with which instrument — and continue; a blocked probe never fails the area.

### 2. Record Evidence

- Record each probe's concrete observations as evidence items with anchors (file:line, command output, or graph result). An expectation without an anchor is not evidence.
- Flag candidate findings where evidence contradicts expected behavior, with their anchors; grading and disposition belong to adjudication, not here.
- Discharge every failure-class obligation the plan carried for this area: record each named failure class as confirmed (a candidate finding with its anchor), refuted (the anchor showing it does not hold), or blocked (the toolchain gate that prevented validation). An area does not close with a planned failure-class obligation left unaddressed.
- Append this area's record to `{area_evidence_collection}` for the gather.
