          Elicitation is a dialogue, not a checklist. The goal is to:
          - **Discover** what the user actually needs (which may differ from what they initially ask for)
          - **Clarify** ambiguities before they become implementation assumptions
          - **Establish** clear scope boundaries to prevent scope creep
          - **Define** measurable success criteria

        content: """
          Use a **sequential, conversational approach** to explore requirements. Ask **one question at a time**, wait for the user's response, and give them the option to skip.

          **Key principles:**
          - **One question per turn** - Never present multiple questions in a single message
          - **Skip option always available** - User can say "skip" to move to the next question
          - **Capture answers incrementally** - Build understanding as you go
          - **Adapt based on responses** - Skip irrelevant follow-ups, probe deeper when needed
