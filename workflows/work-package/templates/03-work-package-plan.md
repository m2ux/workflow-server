## Success Criteria

*Based on baseline metrics and gap analysis above*

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1 (addresses gap: [Gap ID])
- [ ] Requirement 2 (addresses gap: [Gap ID])

### Performance Targets
- [ ] **[Metric 1]:** Improve from [baseline] to [target] ([X]% improvement)
- [ ] **[Metric 2]:** Reduce from [baseline] to [target] ([X]% reduction)
- [ ] **[Metric 3]:** Achieve [target] (new capability)

### Quality Requirements
