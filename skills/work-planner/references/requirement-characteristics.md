# Requirement Characteristics

The characteristics an acceptance criterion meets, and the characteristics a set of them meets. Condensed from ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018, clauses 5.2.4 to 5.2.7. The review applies these here.

## Individual

Each criterion has these characteristics.

- **Necessary.**
  It states a capability, constraint, or quality the work must have. Leaving it out leaves that need unmet, and no other criterion meets it. It applies now.
- **Appropriate.**
  The detail matches the level of the work. It states what holds, and does not lock in a design the need does not require.
- **Unambiguous.**
  It can be read in only one way.
- **Complete.**
  It states the condition fully. Knowing whether it holds does not depend on some other text.
- **Singular.**
  It states one capability, constraint, or quality. Several conditions under which that one thing holds are still one criterion.
- **Feasible.**
  It can be met within the cost, schedule, and technical bounds of the work, at an acceptable risk.
- **Verifiable.**
  Its wording lets the realisation be proved, at the level the criterion is written, by inspection, analysis, demonstration, or test. A measure makes that proof easier.
- **Correct.**
  It states the need it came from, accurately.
- **Conforming.**
  It follows the acceptance-criterion form: an end state, one invariant, and a named instrument, as the [shared acceptance criteria](review-criteria.md#shared-acceptance-criteria) define.

## A set

The criteria of one issue, taken together, have these characteristics.

- **Complete.**
  Together they state what the work must achieve. Nothing the set needs is left to be defined later.
- **Consistent.**
  No two conflict or overlap. The same word means the same thing throughout.
- **Feasible.**
  The set can be met within the same cost, schedule, and technical bounds, at an acceptable risk.
- **Comprehensible.**
  A reader can see what the work is expected to achieve, and how that sits with the rest of the plan.
- **Able to be validated.**
  Meeting the set achieves the need the plan states, within its constraints.

## Wording

- **What, not how.**
  A criterion states the condition that holds. A design choice belongs in the Proposal.
- **Bounded words.**
  These make a criterion hard to prove, or open to more than one reading, unless a measure defines them:
  - superlatives, such as best or most;
  - subjective praise, such as easy or robust;
  - vague pronouns, such as it or this;
  - open comparatives, such as better or significant;
  - loopholes, such as if possible or as appropriate;
  - words of totality, such as all, always, or never, unless the set they cover is named;
  - an open-ended promise, such as provide support.
- **Assumptions.**
  An assumption is recorded beside the criterion, in the Problem or the Proposal. It is not written as the criterion.
- **Definitions.**
  A definition is a statement of what a term means. It is not a criterion.
