## 🎯 Overview

Workflow Server uses an **Intent → Skill → Tool** architecture to guide AI agents through structured workflows.

```
User Goal → Intent (problem domain) → Skill (solution domain) → Tools
```
After initial setup of an always-applied [rule](prompts/ide-setup.md), agents:
1. **Match the user's goal** to an [intent](prompts/intents/index.json)
2. **Follow the [skill](prompts/skills/workflow-execution.json) workflow** which orchestrates the right tool sequence
3. **Execute phases** with state management and checkpoint handling

This reduces context overhead and provides deterministic tool selection.

### Supported Intents

| Intent | User Goal |
|--------|-----------|
| `start-workflow` | Begin executing a new workflow from the beginning |
| `resume-workflow` | Continue a workflow that was previously started |
| `end-workflow` | Complete and finalize an active workflow |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MCP Client (Cursor or Claude Desktop)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/m2ux/workflow-server.git
cd workflow-server
npm install

# Set up workflow data (worktree for orphan branch)
git worktree add ./workflow-data workflows

# Build the server
npm run build
```

### Configure MCP Client

**Cursor** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/workflow-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "WORKFLOW_DIR": "/path/to/workflow-server/workflow-data/workflows",
        "GUIDE_DIR": "/path/to/workflow-server/workflow-data/guides"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your MCP client and start executing workflows. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for other IDEs.
