id: dispatch-sub-agents
version: 1.1.0
capability: "Compose sub-agent Task prompts with workflow-server bootstrap instructions, context variables, and supplementary files; dispatch concurrently within platform limits"

description: "Defines the procedure for dispatching sub-agents during a multi-agent orchestrated workflow. The orchestrator provides the agent roster (IDs, activities, context); this skill defines how to compose the Task prompt, include bootstrap instructions, attach context variables and cross-scope supplementary files, and manage concurrent dispatch within platform constraints."

inputs:
  agent_roster:
    description: "List of agents to dispatch, each with: agent_id, activity_id, context variables (e.g., crate_path, checklist_sections, function_registry), supplementary files"
    required: true
  platform_limit:
    description: "Maximum concurrent sub-agents the platform supports (e.g., 4)"
    required: false
    default: 4

  steps[6]:
    - id: compose-prompts
      name: Compose Sub-Agent Prompts
      description: "For each agent in the roster, build a Task prompt containing: (1) workflow-server bootstrap instructions — 'call get_rules() then call get_workflow_activity with the assigned activity_id, follow the activity steps sequentially'; (2) context variables — crate path, in_scope/out_of_scope, function registry entries; (3) supplementary cross-scope files — file paths from other crates needed for cross-boundary checks; (4) output format requirement — 'return structured output conforming to the output schema resource.'"
    - id: partition-waves
      name: Partition Into Waves
      description: "If the roster exceeds the platform limit, partition agents into waves of at most platform_limit agents each. Each wave must include at least one deep-review agent (not only support agents). Dispatch the highest-priority agents in wave 1."
    - id: dispatch-wave
      name: Dispatch Current Wave
      description: "Submit all agents in the current wave as concurrent Task calls. Each Task call uses the composed prompt from step 1."
    - id: collect-wave
      name: Collect Wave Results
      description: "Wait for all agents in the current wave to return. Collect structured output from each. If any agent fails or times out, record the failure and proceed with available results."
    - id: advance-or-complete
      name: Advance to Next Wave or Complete
      description: "If more waves remain, dispatch the next wave (repeat steps 3-4). Otherwise, return all collected results to the orchestrator."
    - id: verify-dispatch-completeness
      name: Verify Dispatch Completeness
      description: "After all waves complete, compare the agent_roster (input) against the dispatched agent list. Every agent in the roster must have been dispatched and returned a result (success or failure). Produce a dispatch manifest table: agent_id, assigned_crate, dispatched (yes/no), returned (yes/no), status. If any agent was NOT dispatched, flag as INCOMPLETE and return the manifest to the orchestrator for remediation. Set agents_dispatched count. This step enforces the v4.4 dispatch completeness gate."

output:

  incomplete_dispatch:
    cause: "One or more agents in the roster were not dispatched (e.g., Wave 2 skipped due to context pressure)"
    recovery: "Return INCOMPLETE status with the dispatch manifest. The orchestrator MUST dispatch the missing agents in a follow-up wave or flag the audit as incomplete. Do NOT proceed to structured-merge with missing agents."
