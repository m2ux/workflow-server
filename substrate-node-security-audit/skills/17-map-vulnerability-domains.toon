id: map-vulnerability-domains
version: 2.0.0
capability: "Bind architectural analysis artifacts to §3 verification procedures, producing a structured domain map partitioned by crate"

description: "A mechanical binding skill that connects security-relevant architectural properties (from the sub-architectural-analysis agent) to the corresponding §3 checklist verification procedures. Does NOT perform reasoning — that was done by the architecture sub-agent. This skill maps each interaction model entry, privilege map entry, and emergent domain to the §3 item(s) that verify it, then partitions the result by crate for sub-agent distribution."

inputs:
  interaction_model:
    description: "Component interaction model with trust assumptions and security properties (from sub-architectural-analysis)"
    required: true
  privilege_map:
    description: "Privilege and authority map with verification points (from sub-architectural-analysis)"
    required: true
  candidate_points:
    description: "Ranked candidate point list (from sub-architectural-analysis)"
    required: true
  emergent_domains:
    description: "Vulnerability domains not covered by §3 (from sub-architectural-analysis)"
    required: false
  crate_map:
    description: "Classification of crates by category and priority (from reconnaissance)"
    required: true
  target_profile:
    description: "Resource 06 — target-specific domain hints to supplement architectural analysis"
    required: false

protocol:
  description: "For each architectural artifact entry, bind to the applicable §3 verification procedure(s) and partition by crate."
  steps[4]:
    - id: bind-interactions-to-checklist
      name: Bind Interaction Model to §3 Items
      description: "For each component interaction, match the required security property to the §3 item that verifies it. Mapping rules: data consistency across boundaries → §3.2; partial-success event paths → §3.3; asymmetric provider sets → §3.4; genesis state sources → §3.5; unvalidated external input → §3.6; shared resources with mixed consumers → §3.8; cross-chain timestamp propagation → §3.10; typed enum dispatch → §3.14. Interactions with no matching §3 item are flagged as emergent domains."
    - id: bind-privilege-to-checklist
      name: Bind Privilege Map to §3 Items
      description: "For each privilege entry, match to: weight/metering → §3.1; access control → §3.13; upgrade safety → §3.12; genesis consistency → §3.5. Entries where authority verification is absent or inconsistent become priority review targets."
    - id: incorporate-emergent-domains
      name: Incorporate Emergent Domains
      description: "For each emergent domain (from sub-architectural-analysis or from interactions with no §3 match), create an ad-hoc review entry with: domain description, affected components, suggested verification approach. These are distributed to the relevant Group A agents as additional review items beyond §3."
    - id: partition-by-crate
      name: Partition Domain Map by Crate
      description: "Group all domain map entries by crate. Each crate's partition includes: §3 entries with specific locations and verification targets, candidate points ranked by security relevance, and any ad-hoc emergent domain review items. Merge with target profile domain hints if available."

output:
  description: "Structured domain map partitioned by crate, ready for sub-agent distribution."

    - "Per-crate candidate points: location, complexity_reason, trust_boundary_proximity"
