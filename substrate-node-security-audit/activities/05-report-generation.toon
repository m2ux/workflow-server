description: "Consolidate all findings from primary audit and adversarial verification into a final report. Uses the structured merge table from primary-audit as the canonical finding inventory. Apply severity scoring rubric with cross-check against calibration examples, verify coverage gate, and produce the deliverable audit report. Fully automated — no user checkpoints."
problem: Findings from multiple agents and phases must be severity-calibrated and formatted into a cohesive report with coverage verification. The structured merge table from primary-audit ensures no findings are lost.

rules[5]:
  - "The structured merge table from primary-audit is the canonical finding inventory — every row must appear in the report as a finding or be explicitly marked as merged"
  - "Coverage gate (§5.14): every >200-line file in priority-1/2 crates must have been read"
  - "CONTAMINATION GUARD: The reference report is quarantined until the gap-analysis activity. DO NOT read, open, or query the reference report during report generation."
  - "BLOCKING ENTRY CONDITION: This activity MUST NOT begin unless the coverage gate was verified by the verification sub-agent (V) during primary-audit. If coverage_report shows any UNREAD files, return to primary-audit and dispatch follow-up agents. Proceeding to report generation with unread files is the primary cause of coverage regression."
  - "MANDATORY TABLE VERIFICATION: Before writing the report, verify that the following mandatory tables were produced during primary-audit: (a) §3.3 per-field event trace tables for all pallet agents, (b) §3.5 StorageInit construction site enumeration from the node startup agent (A3), (c) Group D per-function checklist matrix. Missing tables indicate incomplete review and MUST be resolved before the report is finalized."
