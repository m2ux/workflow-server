name: "Sub-Agent: Crate Deep Review"
description: "Workflow for Group A sub-agents. Executes an 8-step structured crate review with verifiable outputs at each stage. Each step defines a REQUIRED OUTPUT that must be produced before proceeding. The sub-agent loads this activity via get_workflow_activity and follows it sequentially."
problem: "Sub-agents receiving free-form prompts skip per-field trace tables, mark PASS without cross-function comparison, and return prose instead of structured output. This activity enforces step-by-step execution with verifiable intermediate outputs."

rules[5]:
  - "This activity is dispatched by the orchestrator during primary-audit — it does NOT appear in the main workflow transition graph"
  - "The sub-agent receives context variables: crate_path, checklist_sections, function_registry, supplementary_files, in_scope, out_of_scope"
  - "Every step defines a REQUIRED OUTPUT. The agent must produce this output before proceeding to the next step."
  - "Steps 5 and 6 contain self-verification requirements — the agent must list what it produced and what it marked N/A"
  - "The final output must conform to the structured schema in resource 04 (sub-agent-output-schema)"
