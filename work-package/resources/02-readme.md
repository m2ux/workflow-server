# Work Package README Guide — Consolidated

> **Consolidated into [01-readme.md](01-readme.md) as of v2.0.0.**

The planning folder entry point is now `README.md` (previously `START-HERE.md`). This conforms to the Git convention where hosting platforms automatically render `README.md` when browsing a directory.

The `README.md` file serves as both the executive summary and the artifact index for the planning folder — there is no longer a separate navigation document.

See [01-readme.md](01-readme.md) for the complete guideline and template.
