# TOON → markdown migration (work-package pilot)

> **Phase 1 of the markdown-skills migration.** Translate the existing TOON skill and resource content into markdown-skill form on the new architecture, landing it in **the one ontology** ([workflow-canonical](./sample/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md)). A migrated TOON skill becomes a **technique** (`metadata.kind: technique`, `metadata.ontology: workflow-canonical`) that **keeps its existing section shape** (`Capability / Protocol / Rules / Errors`); a migrated TOON resource becomes a **freeform resource** (no `metadata.ontology`, no `metadata.kind`). Functional parity with the pre-migration workflow-server is the success criterion.
>
> **Why this phase exists:** the architectural move from TOON to markdown is substantive and largely orthogonal to the richer ontological restructuring. Phase 1 de-risks by performing the structural translation with minimal content re-cutting — every migrated skill keeps its TOON-shaped section body, which the one ontology accepts as a valid (self-contained) technique body. Phase 2 ([workflow-canonical-plan.md](./workflow-canonical-plan.md)) restructures that content into the ontology's richer composing-technique decomposition (a composing body that references nested techniques) on top of an already-proven architecture.

---

## 1. Goal & non-goals

### Goal

Translate every TOON skill file and every resource file from the existing `workflows` branch into the new markdown-skills architecture — TOON skills landing as **techniques** (carrying `metadata.ontology: workflow-canonical` + `metadata.kind: technique`, keeping their existing section shape) and TOON resources landing as **freeform resources** — on a new **`skills`** orphan branch, with **behaviour identical** to the pre-migration workflow-server when agents fetch and execute content.

Phase 1 completes when:

1. All 10 workflows' skill and resource content lives on the `skills` branch in markdown form.
2. The workflow-server serves agents exclusively from the `skills` branch (skill/resource content) and the `workflows` branch (workflow.toon, activities/).
3. The legacy TOON skills/resources are **removed** from the `workflows` branch (see Phase 1.8) — single source of truth.

### Non-goals (Phase 1 explicitly excludes)

- The richer workflow-canonical restructuring — decomposing each migrated technique into a composing body + nested techniques, pulling cross-cutting protocol phases into shared techniques, subsuming resources into technique bodies. Deferred to Phase 2 ([workflow-canonical-plan.md](./workflow-canonical-plan.md)). Phase 1 lands content in the one ontology but keeps each technique's body in its TOON-derived `Capability / Protocol / Rules / Errors` shape — a valid (self-contained) technique body, not yet decomposed.
- Any content edits beyond mechanical TOON-to-markdown translation, **except for four adopted refinements** (see §5.5): cross-references rendered as file-relative markdown hyperlinks (with the dual-hyperlink `::` form for operation references, the `apply` verb when invoking operations, and inline-code-wrapped `{params}` without surrounding parens); resource references distributed inline at point-of-use rather than collected in a `## Resources` section; consistent tool-usage promoted to a tool-operations technique (the `gitnexus-operations` divergence); and the `*-operations` pattern (per-op child files) applied to operations-style techniques (cargo-operations, gitnexus-operations, validate-build, dco-provenance, manage-artifacts, manage-git). No other rewording, restructuring, or content-drift fixes.
- **Structural** changes to `workflow.toon` and `activities/*.toon` files. They stay in the existing `workflows` branch with their structure intact. **Exception:** path-shaped reference strings inside them are rewritten to slug-form by Phase 1.4b (see §6) — pure string replacement, no schema or shape changes.
- Schema migration (`schemas/skill.schema.ts` etc.). The one ontology is informally specified by its definition resource ([sample/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md](./sample/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md)), not by a Zod schema.
- Sub-skill nesting. Phase 1 migrated content is flat by construction (each TOON skill becomes a single self-contained technique; resources don't compose into deeper structures). The ontology permits nesting; Phase 1 chooses not to use it.

## 2. Settled decisions

| Decision | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow scope | All 10 workflows in one pass | User answer, 2026-05-23 |
| TOON→markdown mapping | Each top-level TOON field becomes a `##` section; nested objects become deeper headings | User answer, 2026-05-23 |
| Folder slug | Drop the `NN-` order prefix; folder is just the slug. Order preserved as `metadata.order`. | User answer, 2026-05-23 |
| Resource references | Root-relative markdown hyperlinks to the target SKILL.md (`[slug](legacy/<workflow>/resources/<slug>/SKILL.md)`), placed **inline at point-of-use** — no `## Resources` section | User decisions, 2026-05-23 / 2026-05-27 |
| Branch name | `skills` (new orphan branch, separate from existing `workflows` branch) | User instruction |
| Top-level folder | `legacy/` (under the orphan branch root) — a plain folder name, no ontological meaning | User instruction |
| Per-workflow structure | `legacy/<workflow>/techniques/` (techniques), `legacy/<workflow>/resources/` (freeform resources) | User instruction |
| Ontology definition location | `shared/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md` (a shared freeform resource) | Architecture convention |

## 3. How migrated content fits the one ontology

There is **one ontology** ([workflow-canonical](./sample/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md)). Migrated content maps onto its two content categories — **technique** and **freeform resource** — with no separate "legacy" ontology and no `skill`/`resource` content kinds.

### How the two TOON file types map

- **A TOON skill** (e.g. `10-implement-task.toon`) becomes a **technique** — `metadata.kind: technique`, `metadata.ontology: workflow-canonical`. It carries protocol, rules, inputs/outputs, error definitions, resource references. The ontology accepts a `Capability / Protocol / Rules / Errors` body as a valid self-contained technique body, so the migration **keeps the TOON section shape** rather than decomposing into nested techniques (that decomposition is Phase 2). Consumed by agents executing workflow activities; the server delivers it as TOON.
- **A TOON or markdown resource** (`resources/NN-*.md` or `resources/NN-*.toon`) becomes a **freeform resource** — `name` + `description` only, carrying **neither** `metadata.ontology` **nor** `metadata.kind`. Reference material — templates, criteria, primers, glossaries. Referenced from techniques by inline file-relative hyperlink at point-of-use; the server delivers it as simplified markdown.

### The ontology definition

The ontology is defined by a single freeform shared resource at `shared/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md` — there is **no meta-skill kind** and **no `skills/meta/` location convention**. The definition resource (drafted at [sample/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md](./sample/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md)) describes:

- The two content categories (what a `technique` and a freeform `resource` are, structurally and semantically).
- The TOON-field → markdown-section mapping (§5 of this plan is the canonical reference for the migration convention).
- The cross-reference convention: file-relative markdown hyperlinks to the target SKILL.md — relative to the *referencing file's own directory*, so they click through in any IDE / GitHub / markdown renderer (e.g. from one technique to a sibling, `[<slug>](../<slug>/SKILL.md)`; from a technique to a resource, `[<slug>](../../resources/<slug>/SKILL.md)`; the `../` depth follows from where the two files sit). To reference a **specific operation or section** of another skill, hyperlink both parts joined by `::`: `[<skill>](../<skill>/SKILL.md)::[<op>](../<skill>/SKILL.md#<op>)` (params after, e.g. `` `{target, direction}` ``); within the same file a sibling section is just `[<op>](#<op>)`.
- The frontmatter schema for techniques and resources.
- Bootstrap protocol: an agent encountering a technique whose `metadata.ontology` names `workflow-canonical` resolves that name (workflow-local → shared/) and loads this definition resource before interpreting the technique.

Phase 1 lands all 10 workflows in this one ontology, keeping technique bodies in TOON-derived section shape. Phase 2 ([workflow-canonical-plan.md](./workflow-canonical-plan.md)) restructures specific workflows into the ontology's richer composing-body decomposition (composing techniques that reference nested techniques).

```

Per-technique / per-resource shape: each is a folder containing a single `SKILL.md`. No sub-folders. Sub-files are reserved for the `*-operations` pattern (one operation per sibling `<op>.md`, no frontmatter — see §5.5); all other techniques and every resource are a single `SKILL.md`. Flat (Phase 1 does not nest; the ontology permits it, Phase 2 uses it).

---

## 5. TOON → markdown transformation rules

### 5.1 Frontmatter

Every migrated SKILL.md carries top-level fields per the agentskills.io spec. A migrated **technique** (from a TOON skill) also carries a `metadata:` block; a migrated **freeform resource** carries no `metadata.ontology`/`metadata.kind` (only `name`/`description` plus optional author data such as `order`/`legacy_id`).

| Source (TOON) | Target (markdown frontmatter) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id:` | top-level `name:` | matches the directory slug |
| `description:` | top-level `description:` | 1–1024 chars per spec |
| (implicit, techniques only) | `metadata.ontology: workflow-canonical` | the one ontology; **techniques only** — resources carry neither this nor `kind` |
| (implicit, techniques only) | `metadata.kind: technique` | techniques only |
| `version:` | `metadata.version:` | preserved if present |
| (filename prefix) | `metadata.order: <NN>` | the numeric prefix from `NN-<slug>.toon`; preserved for workflow-iteration semantics |
| (filename prefix) | `metadata.legacy_id: <NN>` | preserved so cross-references by numeric ID still resolve during transition |

Example frontmatter for a migrated technique (from a TOON skill):

```yaml
---
name: implement-task
description: Implement a single task from the plan by writing code changes.
metadata:
  ontology: workflow-canonical
  kind: technique
  version: 2.1.3
  order: 10
  legacy_id: 10
---
```

For a migrated freeform resource (carries neither `ontology` nor `kind`):

```yaml
---
name: gitnexus-reference
description: GitNexus MCP tools and graph schema reference.
metadata:
  order: 27
  legacy_id: 27
---
```

### 5.2 Body — TOON field → `##` section

Each top-level TOON field becomes a `##` heading. Nested objects become `###` (and deeper) headings. Lists stay as markdown lists. The convention is **mechanical and round-trippable**.

The full mapping table for TOON skills:

| TOON field | Markdown section |
|---|---|
| `capability:` | `## Capability` (paragraph body) |
| `inputs[N]:` | `## Inputs`, each input as a `### <id>` subsection (lead the body with `*(optional)*` when `required: false`) |
| `protocol:` (with named phases) | `## Protocol`, each phase as `### N. <Phase Title>` (ordinal-numbered) with bullet-list body |
| `output[N]:` | `## Outputs` (**plural — renamed from the TOON singular `output`**), each output as a `### <id>` subsection |
| `rules:` (named rules with text) | `## Rules`, each rule as a `### <rule-name>` subsection |
| `resources[N]:` (list of refs) | **No `## Resources` section.** Each referenced resource is rendered as an inline hyperlink at its point-of-use within the consuming section (see §5.3) |
| `errors:` (named errors with cause/recovery) | `## Errors`, each error as `### <error-name>` with `**Cause:**` and `**Recovery:**` lines |

For resource files (mostly markdown already), the existing content body becomes the body verbatim. Only frontmatter is added.

For resource files that are TOON (the `*.toon` extension under `resources/`), apply the same field-to-section mapping as for skills.

### 5.3 Cross-reference rewriting (inline hyperlinks)

TOON skills reference resources by numeric ID inside the `resources:` field. These are **not** collected into a trailing `## Resources` section. Instead each resource is rendered as a **file-relative markdown hyperlink at its point-of-use** — inside the protocol phase, rule, or other section that actually consumes it:

| Source (TOON) | Target (markdown, inline at point-of-use) |
|---|---|
| `resources[N]: ["27"]` (referenced from a protocol step inside a technique) | `… see [gitnexus-reference](../../resources/gitnexus-reference/SKILL.md) …` |

Convention:

- **Link text** is the target slug (e.g. `gitnexus-reference`); the **target** is **file-relative** — relative to the referencing file's own directory, so it clicks through in any IDE / GitHub / markdown renderer — and always ends in `/SKILL.md` so it resolves to a real, openable file. The `../` depth follows from where the two files sit: a technique referencing a sibling resource emits `../../resources/<slug>/SKILL.md` (up out of `techniques/<skill>/`, across into `resources/<slug>/`). To fetch, an agent strips the trailing `/SKILL.md` and calls `get_skill` on the resolved name.
- **Placement** is at point-of-use. A resource listed in the source `resources:` field but not named anywhere in the body is placed where its content is most relevant, or surfaced to the user when placement is ambiguous.

The rewrite requires the migration tooling to:
1. Walk the workflow's resources/ directory and build a numeric-ID → slug map.
2. For each in-body resource reference, look up the slug and emit the inline hyperlink at the consuming location.

Slug derivation: strip the `NN-` prefix and the file extension from the resource's filename. E.g. `27-gitnexus-reference.md` → `gitnexus-reference`.

References that fail to resolve (numeric ID not found in the workflow's resources/) are flagged as fidelity violations.

```

The target above reflects the adopted refinements (§5.5) layered on the mechanical mapping. Note three departures from a naive field-to-section translation of the source TOON:

- The source's `resource 27` in-body pointer becomes a **file-relative hyperlink** at point-of-use; resources are distributed inline, so there is **no `## Resources` section**.
- The source's raw `gitnexus_*` calls become references to the **`gitnexus-operations`** operations technique.
- The source's `gitnexus-discipline` rule is **dropped** — the tool-usage policy it restated now lives once inside `gitnexus-operations`.

### 5.5 Adopted refinements beyond mechanical mapping

Four refinements were adopted during the work-package pilot (2026-05-23 → 2026-05-27). They are deliberate departures from a pure 1:1 mechanical mirror; everything else stays mechanical.

#### Cross-references as file-relative hyperlinks

Every technique→technique and technique→resource reference is a file-relative markdown hyperlink to the target SKILL.md (link text = target slug; path relative to the *referencing file's own directory*, so it clicks through in any IDE / GitHub / markdown renderer; always ends in `/SKILL.md`). The `../` depth follows from where the two files sit — a technique referencing a sibling technique emits `[<slug>](../<slug>/SKILL.md)`; a technique referencing a resource emits `[<slug>](../../resources/<slug>/SKILL.md)`. This replaces the earlier `skill:<path>` specifier idea. The ontology definition resource documents this as its "Cross-reference format". To fetch, an agent strips the trailing `/SKILL.md` and calls `get_skill` on the resolved name.

To reference a **specific operation or section** of another skill, hyperlink BOTH parts — the skill name to its `SKILL.md` and the op/section name to wherever it lives — joined by `::`, with any params after: `[<skill>](../<skill>/SKILL.md)::[<op>](../<skill>/SKILL.md#<op>)` `{params}`. When the operation lives in its own **child file** (the `*-operations` pattern, below), the second link targets the file directly with no anchor: `[<skill>](../<skill>/SKILL.md)::[<op>](../<skill>/<op>.md)`. Within the same skill folder a sibling operation is `[<op>](<op>.md)`; within the same file a section is `[<op>](#<op>)`. This is the at-rest, human-navigable form of per-section addressing: on delivery the server simplifies each to a bare name (`<skill>` or `<skill>/<segment>`), which `get_skill` resolves by precedence — the underlying storage (section, child file, or nested skill) is transparent to the caller.

#### Resources distributed inline (no `## Resources` section)

The source TOON collected resource references in a trailing `resources:` list. The migration distributes each to its point-of-use as an inline hyperlink (see §5.3); the `## Resources` section is removed entirely. Rationale: a reader encounters each reference where it matters rather than as a disconnected trailing list. A resource declared but never named in the body is placed where its content is most relevant, or surfaced to the user when ambiguous.

#### Consistent tool-usage promoted to operations techniques (the `gitnexus-operations` divergence)

Where a tool was driven in a consistent, parameterised way across many techniques, that usage is promoted to **operations in a tool-operations technique** and referenced from protocol steps as `<tool>-operations::<op>` — rather than restated inline in every technique and reinforced by per-technique "rules". This mirrors the pre-existing `cargo-operations` technique (operations with Inputs/Output/Procedure/Errors shape, referenced as `cargo-operations::check`, enforced by a single `resource-budget` rule). Tool identity is not its own section — the procedure names the tool inline (`cargo …`, `gitnexus_*(…)`).

The pilot applied this to GitNexus:

- **New technique** `legacy/work-package/techniques/gitnexus-operations/SKILL.md` (`metadata.kind: technique`, `metadata.ontology: workflow-canonical`). It is **migration-introduced** — it has no 1:1 source TOON file (the GitNexus analogue of `cargo-operations`). Assigned `order`/`legacy_id` 26 (unreferenced; net-new).
- **Five primitive operations** wrap the MCP tools with the canonical parameter set and output interpretation: `impact`, `context`, `detect-changes`, `query`, `cypher`.
- **Seven composite operations** encode the multi-call recipes that recurred across skills (formerly duplicated in the `gitnexus-reference` resource's "Work-package Integration Patterns" prose): `orphan-scan`, `public-api-enum`, `diff-coverage-map`, `scope-discipline-check`, `diagram-source-select`, `complexity-signal`, `reversibility-signal`.
- **Two policy rules** in the new skill: `must-use-operations` (analysis goes through the operations; grep is the unindexed/stale fallback) and `index-freshness` (staleness handling, centralised).
- **15 consuming techniques** had their inline `gitnexus_*` calls rewritten to operation references with parameter sets; **four tool-usage "rules" were removed** (`implement-task::gitnexus-discipline`, `build-comprehension::gitnexus-usage`, `analyze-implementation::gitnexus-first-locate`, `reconcile-assumptions::tool-usage`).
- The **`gitnexus-reference` resource** was trimmed: its "Work-package Integration Patterns" prose section was removed (now the composite operations); the tool/schema/CLI reference material remains.

Forward-compatibility: this flat operations-technique maps cleanly onto the workflow-canonical "Tool" concept (a tool-dedicated namespace resource) in Phase 2. The same lens applies to other tools driven via per-technique rules (e.g. `gh` in `create-issue`/`update-pr`) — candidates for the same treatment, deferred.

#### `*-operations` techniques split into per-operation child files

Operations-style techniques (those whose body is a flat list of named, externally-callable operations rather than an ordered protocol) are stored as a parent `SKILL.md` index plus one child file per operation. The parent SKILL.md carries the frontmatter (`metadata.ontology` + `kind: technique`), the `## Capability` blurb, the `## Operations` table (each row links to the child file), and the **cross-cutting** `## Rules` (constraints that govern multiple operations). Each child file is plain markdown with no frontmatter and the operation's per-section shape:

- `# <op>` h1 (operation name) + one-line description (always present).
- `## Procedure` (always present — without it the file is not an operation). The procedure body is **always a numbered list** (`1. …`, `2. …`); single-step procedures are still numbered (`1. …`). Tool identity is named inline by the step (`cargo …`, `gitnexus_*(…)`); there is no separate `## Tools` section. **Verb convention:** when a step invokes another operation, use the verb **`apply`** (or `Apply` / `re-apply`). Operations are *applied*, not `run`, `called`, or `invoked`. Reserve `call` and `invoke` for underlying tool invocations (MCP tool calls like `gitnexus_*`, shell commands like `cargo …`). **Parameter form:** when params follow an op reference, render them as inline-code-wrapped braces — `` `{name: value, ...}` `` — **without** surrounding parens. The braces alone denote the parameter set; outer parens are redundant.
- `## Inputs`, `## Output`, `## Errors`, `## Rules` — **present only when the operation has them**. An op with no inputs (e.g. `cargo-operations/preflight`) omits `## Inputs`; an op that writes in place with no structured return (e.g. `cargo-operations/fmt-fix`) omits `## Output`; an op with no failure modes worth surfacing omits `## Errors`; an op with no local constraints omits `## Rules`.
- `## Errors` and `## Rules` use the **named-subsection form** (each entry is `### <name>` with a multi-paragraph body), mirroring the existing protocol-technique convention. `## Inputs` and `## Output` use the bullet form (each field is `- **<name>** — <description>`) — they carry one short description per field.
- **Only the canonical sections above** may appear in a child op file. No "Harness implementations", "Schema reference", "Notes", "Examples", or other extension `##` sections — they would break the server's TOON projection (§7) which expects a fixed schema. Variant logic (per-harness, per-environment, conditional invocations) MUST be encoded in the procedure by branching on a declared input — e.g. `harness-compat::spawn-agent` takes a `harness` input and the procedure step names the per-harness invocation inline. Reference tables (e.g. risk classifications, schema references) belong inside the relevant `## Output` description or as a procedure step, not as a separate section.

**Rules placement — parent vs op-local.** Cross-cutting rules (those that govern multiple operations) live in the parent SKILL.md's `## Rules`. Op-local rules (those that apply only to one operation) live in that operation's own child-file `## Rules` section. A rule moves down when it constrains exactly one operation, and stays up when it spans two or more. The cargo-operations migration applied this distinction: `release-builds-keep-wasm` → [build-release.md](legacy/work-package/techniques/cargo-operations/build-release.md#rules) (renamed `keeps-wasm-artifact`); `prefer-nextest` → [test.md](legacy/work-package/techniques/cargo-operations/test.md#rules); `fmt-uses-only-nice` stays parent-level because it spans two ops; the three genuinely cross-cutting ones (`resource-budget`, `foreground-only`, `scope-narrow-then-wide`) stay parent-level.

**Identifying candidates.** The structural marker (`## Operations` in the source) catches the obvious cases, but the semantic test is decisive: a technique is operations-style when its numbered steps are *independently-invocable named callables* — different callers invoke different "steps", they don't run as one execution. Diagnostic signals: inverse pairs (create/remove), conditional gating (step N depends on step M's output rather than naturally following it), different lifecycle points (one at activity start, another at end), deprecated-but-retained steps, conventions-dressed-as-steps. A technique whose numbered steps are an ordered execution of one invocation is protocol-style and stays unsplit.

The pilot applied this to **6 techniques** in the work-package legacy bundle, producing **40 op files**:

- **`cargo-operations`** — 10 child files: `check.md`, `test.md`, `build-dev.md`, `build-release.md`, `clippy.md`, `fmt-check.md`, `fmt-fix.md`, `doc.md`, `preflight.md`, `run-suite.md`.
- **`gitnexus-operations`** — 12 child files: `impact.md`, `context.md`, `detect-changes.md`, `query.md`, `cypher.md` (primitive) and `orphan-scan.md`, `public-api-enum.md`, `diff-coverage-map.md`, `scope-discipline-check.md`, `diagram-source-select.md`, `complexity-signal.md`, `reversibility-signal.md` (composite).
- **`validate-build`** — 3 child files: `analyze-failure.md`, `apply-fix.md`, `aggregate-results.md`. Already structurally `## Operations`-style; the split materialised each into its own file. Technique-level errors redistributed to the ops that raise them.
- **`dco-provenance`** — 2 child files: `append-task-row.md` (per-task append, idempotent init), `record-attestation.md` (once at the dco-sign-off checkpoint). Step 3 (Context Scope vocabulary) folded into `append-task-row`'s `context_scope` input description.
- **`manage-artifacts`** — 4 child files: `create-folder.md`, `create-readme.md`, `write-artifact.md`, `verify-readme-conforms.md` (which already existed as a sibling operation in the source). Step 3 (Apply Prefix) deleted as a duplicate of the `activity-prefix` rule.
- **`manage-git`** — 9 child files: `update-reference-submodules.md`, `create-worktree.md`, `remove-worktree.md`, `create-pr.md`, `sync-branch.md`, `detect-merge-strategy.md`, `squash-merge.md`, `push-commits.md`, `artifact-commits.md`. Deprecated `Create Branch` step dropped. `Code Commits` promoted to the parent SKILL.md as the `code-commit-coauthor-trailer` rule.

This is structural enforcement of the operations idiom — the file layout makes the named-callable shape obvious, makes diffs scoped to one operation, and lets the server deliver just the file the caller's protocol step references (per-section addressing, architecture.md §6.1, resolution path 2: sibling supporting file). Protocol-style techniques (those with `## Protocol` and ordered numbered steps that are sequential phases of one execution) are NOT split — their steps are not externally addressable.

## 6. Phase plan

### Phase 1.0 — Pre-flight inventory

- Walk all 10 workflows in the existing `workflows` branch. List every skill file and every resource file. Note shape variance: any TOON field used in one workflow but not another, any non-standard frontmatter, any custom conventions.
- Output: `legacy-migration-inventory.md` artifact listing per-workflow file counts and shape oddities.
- Risk surfacing: any TOON skill with unusual fields gets flagged here so the migration tooling handles it.

### Phase 1.1 — Author the ontology definition resource

- Author `shared/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md` (a freeform shared resource) on the new orphan branch (Phase 1.3 creates the branch; this content can be authored against the planning-folder sample at [sample/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md](./sample/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md) first and committed).
- Content: the two content categories (technique vs freeform resource), the TOON-field → markdown-section mapping (per §5 of this plan), the cross-reference (file-relative hyperlink) convention, the bootstrap protocol, frontmatter schema.
- Validate: an agent reading just this definition resource can correctly interpret a migrated SKILL.md.

### Phase 1.2 — Build the migration tooling

- One-off script (TypeScript, lives under `scripts/migrate-legacy/` in the workflow-server repo).
- Inputs: a workflow root path (e.g. `workflows/work-package/`).
- Outputs: a populated `legacy/<workflow>/` tree containing `techniques/<slug>/SKILL.md` and `resources/<slug>/SKILL.md` for every input file.
- Responsibilities:
  - Parse TOON skill files (`@toon-format/toon` library, already a dependency).
  - Parse resource files (markdown if `.md`; TOON if `.toon`).
  - Build the numeric-ID → slug map per workflow (resources first, since skills reference resources).
  - Emit markdown per the mapping in §5.
  - Rewrite resource references to inline file-relative hyperlinks at their point-of-use.
  - Validate every emitted SKILL.md round-trips (markdown → TOON-equivalent structure → byte-identical to source modulo formatting).
- Idempotent — running twice on the same input produces the same output.
- Reports per-workflow stats: count of skills migrated, count of resources migrated, count of references rewritten, count of unresolvable references (failures).

### Phase 1.3 — Create the orphan branch and scaffold

- Create the `skills` orphan branch in the workflow-server repo (`git checkout --orphan skills`).
- Initial commit: the bare folder structure (`legacy/`, `shared/resources/`) plus the authored ontology definition resource from Phase 1.1.
- Push to remote.
- Add a `git worktree` instruction to README.md (e.g. `git worktree add ./skills skills`) so contributors can check out the new branch alongside the main branch.

### Phase 1.4 — Migrate workflows (per-workflow batches)

For each of the 10 workflows, in this order:
1. `work-package` (largest; canary)
2. `prism`, `prism-audit`, `prism-evaluate`, `prism-update`, `prism-evaluate` family
3. `remediate-vuln`
4. `substrate-node-security-audit`
5. `cicd-pipeline-security-audit`
6. `work-packages`
7. `workflow-design`
8. `meta`

Steps per workflow:

1. Run the migration tooling against the workflow root.
2. Review the output: spot-check 3–5 randomly selected migrated files; confirm content fidelity.
3. Run the tooling's round-trip validation.
4. Commit to the `skills` branch under `legacy/<workflow>/`.
5. Note any unresolvable references; resolve manually if needed.

### Phase 1.4b — Update path-shaped references in `workflow.toon` and activities

Concurrent with Phase 1.4 (per-workflow): the workflow definition files (`workflow.toon` and `activities/*.toon`) contain some references in path-shape (e.g. `resource: resources/24-review-mode.md`) that break post-migration. These must be rewritten.

For each workflow, the migration tooling scans `workflow.toon` and `activities/*.toon` for:

- Path references of the form `resources/NN-<slug>.md|toon` — rewrite to plain slug (e.g. `review-mode`). The server resolves the slug per §8.2.
- Path references of the form `resources/NN-<slug>` (no extension) — same treatment.
- Numeric-ID-style references in description text ("see resource 27") — left as prose. The server resolves these at agent-fetch time via the `metadata.legacy_id` index per §8.2.

These changes commit to the **existing `workflows` branch** (NOT the new `skills` branch). It's the one part of Phase 1 that touches workflows/* files — but only path strings, never structure. The plan's earlier non-goal "workflow.toon stays unchanged" is **softened** to "workflow.toon structure stays unchanged; embedded path strings are updated to slug references."

### Phase 1.5 — Server-side support (markdown loader update)

- Implement the markdown loader in the workflow-server per [architecture.md §8](./architecture.md#8-migration-approach-any-workflow-any-ontology). The loader walks the `skills` branch (mounted as a worktree alongside the main repo).
- Generalise `get_skill(name)` to resolve names under the new tree by precedence (workflow-local → shared/): `legacy/<workflow>/techniques/<slug>`, `legacy/<workflow>/resources/<slug>`, `shared/resources/workflow-canonical`.
- No special server-side rewriting is needed for in-body references: the body contains file-relative markdown hyperlinks to SKILL.md files, which the agent resolves via subsequent `get_skill` calls (stripping the trailing `/SKILL.md`).
- **No regression on the TOON path** during the transition window: existing `get_skill(<id>)` calls into the `workflows` branch still work. The server runs in dual-mode (both branches loadable) until cutover (Phase 1.7).
- Add a CI check that validates every file-relative SKILL.md hyperlink in the new tree resolves to an existing file.

### Phase 1.6 — Parity validation

For each workflow (in the order from Phase 1.4):

- Run a representative agent task end-to-end using the NEW branch as the skill source.
- Compare against the same task run with the OLD `workflows` branch as the source. Both should produce equivalent artifacts.
- Acceptable variance: prose-level formatting differences in agent-produced output. Substantive differences (different decisions, missed steps, missed rules) are fidelity failures.
- Specifically test:
  - Skill loading by name resolves to the right SKILL.md.
  - Resource references within skill bodies resolve to the right resource SKILL.md.
  - The full content of each TOON field is preserved in the corresponding markdown section.
  - Numeric `legacy_id` references still work as a fallback (older agent sessions may still use them).

### Phase 1.7 — Cutover

- Switch the workflow-server's primary skill source from the `workflows` branch to the `skills` branch.
- The `workflows` branch retains `workflow.toon`, `activities/*.toon` (which the server continues to load from there).
- The `skills` branch carries all skill and resource content (which the server now loads from there).
- Deprecate `get_resource` (the legacy MCP tool); have it return a "moved to legacy/.../SKILL.md" indicator for any pre-migration resource ID still requested. Removed in a follow-up.

### Phase 1.8 — Remove legacy TOON skills and resources from the `workflows` branch

**Mandated**, not optional. Once Phase 1.6 (parity validation) has passed for every workflow:

- Delete every `workflows/<workflow>/skills/*.toon` file.
- Delete every `workflows/<workflow>/resources/*.md` and `workflows/<workflow>/resources/*.toon` file.
- Delete the now-empty `workflows/<workflow>/skills/` and `workflows/<workflow>/resources/` directories.
- The `workflows` branch ends Phase 1 containing only `workflow.toon` and `activities/*.toon` per workflow. All skill and resource content lives exclusively on the `skills` branch.
- Commit the deletions as a single squashed commit per workflow with a clear message (e.g. `legacy migration: remove TOON skills/resources for work-package (now on skills branch)`).
- Update the server's loader to refuse to fall back to the `workflows` branch for skill/resource content — fail-loud rather than silent inconsistency.

**Why mandated and not optional retention:** dual-source coexistence is a footgun. A reader (or a tool) finding TOON content on the `workflows` branch may treat it as authoritative when the markdown content on `skills` has since been edited. Removal forces a single source of truth.

**Rollback contingency:** the `workflows` branch's full TOON content is recoverable from git history (`git checkout <pre-Phase-1.8-commit> -- workflows/<workflow>/skills/`) if a regression is found post-removal. The migration tooling itself is also rerunnable from the same source.

---

## 7. Fidelity criteria

### 7.1 Content fidelity (mechanical)

For every migrated file, the union of (markdown body sections + frontmatter metadata) covers all content from the source TOON file. A diff-based audit script checks:

- Every TOON top-level field has a corresponding `##` section (or frontmatter entry) in the markdown output.
- Every TOON nested object has a corresponding `###` section.
- Every list item from TOON appears as a list item in markdown.
- Numeric resource IDs are preserved in `metadata.legacy_id` even after slug rewriting.

Round-trip validation: an inverse transformation (markdown → TOON-shaped structure) produces a result byte-equivalent to the source TOON modulo formatting (whitespace, key ordering).

### 7.2 Behavioural fidelity

For 3–5 representative agent tasks per workflow, the post-migration worker produces:

- The same tool-call sequence.
- The same produced artifacts (file contents identical modulo formatting).
- The same checkpoint decisions (refusals, escalations).

Acceptable variance: minor wording differences in prose-only output. Substantive variance = fidelity failure → investigate.

### 7.3 Reference fidelity

Every file-relative SKILL.md hyperlink in any migrated file resolves to an existing SKILL.md on the new branch. CI check enforces this.

Additionally, every numeric `legacy_id` reference (for any agent session that still uses them during transition) resolves to a skill with that `metadata.legacy_id` value in the new tree.

## 8. Risks and resolved decisions

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| TOON field variance across workflows breaks the mechanical mapping | Medium | High | Phase 1.0 inventory surfaces variance before tooling is built. Tooling handles known shapes; flags unknowns. |
| Numeric resource references resolve to wrong slugs after slug derivation collision | Low | Medium | Migration tooling builds the ID→slug map per-workflow first; checks for collisions; aborts on collision. |
| Behavioural drift between TOON-served and markdown-served content | Low | High | Phase 1.6 parity validation runs the same task on both paths and diffs the outputs. |
| Loss of `NN-` ordering breaks workflow iteration semantics | Medium | Medium | Preserved as `metadata.order`. Server-side workflow.toon resolver consults `metadata.order` when iterating. |
| The `skills` orphan branch and `workflows` branch get out of sync | High pre-Phase-1.8 | Medium | Phase 1.8 *removes* the TOON content from `workflows`, forcing single source of truth. |
| Migration tooling has bugs that produce subtly-wrong markdown | Medium | High | Spot-check + round-trip validation + parity validation are layered defences. Reviewable diffs per workflow batch. |
| Stale `resource:` path references in workflow.toon break post-migration | High | High | New Phase 1.4b updates these in-place (slug-form references). See §6. |

### Resolved decisions (formerly "open questions")

#### 8.1 Resource file source format

The current `resources/` directories contain a mix of `.md` and `.toon` files. Both formats are migrated:

- **`.md` resources**: the existing body is preserved verbatim. The migration tooling wraps it with freeform-resource frontmatter (`name`, `description`, plus `metadata.legacy_id: <NN>` / `metadata.order: <NN>` — and **no** `metadata.ontology`/`metadata.kind`). The folder slug is derived from the filename minus the `NN-` prefix and `.md` extension.
- **`.toon` resources**: the same field-to-section mapping applied to techniques is applied here. Each top-level TOON field becomes a `##` section; nested objects become deeper headings. The result is still a freeform resource (no `metadata.ontology`/`metadata.kind`).

Phase 1.0 inventory enumerates which workflows have which kind of resource. Both paths are well-defined; no decision needed beyond "support both".

#### 8.2 Reference resolution (workflow.toon and activity → skill/resource)

After Phase 1, four reference shapes appear in the existing TOON content:

1. **Plain slug** (most common in activities — e.g. `review-code`, `manual-diff-review`): resolves to `legacy/<current-workflow>/techniques/<slug>/SKILL.md` OR `legacy/<current-workflow>/resources/<slug>/SKILL.md`. The server tries techniques first, then resources.
2. **Workflow-prefixed slug** (cross-workflow, e.g. `prism/structural-analysis`): resolves to `legacy/<workflow>/techniques/<slug>/SKILL.md`. Same fallback to resources.
3. **Numeric ID** (legacy in-body references like "resource 27"): resolves via the `metadata.legacy_id` reverse index — every migrated SKILL.md carries its `legacy_id`, and the server builds a `(workflow, folder, legacy_id) → path` map at load time (`folder` being `techniques` for techniques or `resources` for freeform resources).
4. **Direct path** (rare; e.g. workflow.toon's `resource: resources/24-review-mode.md`): handled by Phase 1.4b (a sub-step of per-workflow migration) — the migration tooling rewrites these to slug-form references in the workflow.toon source file directly.

The plain-slug path is the canonical post-migration form. Numeric IDs are transitional fallbacks; direct paths are eliminated entirely.

#### 8.3 Ontology versioning

**Not introduced by this migration.** Migrated techniques carry `metadata.ontology: workflow-canonical` with no version suffix; the migration does not add a versioning scheme. Whether the ontology definition itself is ever versioned is an ontology-level question owned by [workflow-canonical-plan.md](./workflow-canonical-plan.md) (its §9.2 open question 8), not this migration plan.

#### 8.4 Ontology-definition location

**`shared/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md`** — a freeform shared resource under the root `shared/` layer, resolved by name under precedence (workflow-local → shared/). There is **no `skills/meta/` location convention and no meta-skill kind**: an ontology definition is just a shared resource, because the thing that defines an ontology cannot itself be governed by it. (`meta/` is not reserved — it is simply the folder of the workflow named `meta`.)

#### 8.5 Sub-skill nesting in Phase 1

**No nesting in Phase 1. Flat by choice.** Every `legacy/<workflow>/techniques/<slug>/` and `legacy/<workflow>/resources/<slug>/` folder contains exactly one `SKILL.md` and no nested folders. The ontology *permits* arbitrary nesting; Phase 1 chooses not to use it.

Reason: TOON skills are flat; Phase 1 is a structural translation that keeps each technique's body self-contained; nesting (a composing body that references nested techniques) is the Phase 2 restructuring. Don't introduce nesting in Phase 1.

#### 8.6 Migration tooling lifecycle

**Keep at `scripts/migrate-legacy/` for one release cycle post-cutover. Archive after Phase 2 (workflow-canonical migration) completes.** Specifically:

- During Phase 1.0–1.8: lives at `scripts/migrate-legacy/` in the workflow-server repo, active code.
- Post-Phase-1.8 cutover: stays in place for a release cycle (rollback insurance; rerunnable if a regression surfaces).
- After Phase 2 stabilises: moved to `.engineering/archive/migration-tooling-legacy-2026/` (no longer executed; preserved as documentation of how the translation was performed).
- Never deleted — the code is small and the historical value (auditing the translation) is real.

---

## 9. Out of scope (Phase 1)

- The richer workflow-canonical restructuring — composing-body decomposition, cross-cutting technique extraction, resource subsumption (Phase 2 — see [workflow-canonical-plan.md](./workflow-canonical-plan.md)).
- Any content edits, additions, deletions, or restructuring beyond field-to-section translation.
- `workflow.toon` and `activities/*.toon` migration.
- Schema migration (the one ontology is informally specified by its definition resource; no Zod schema).
- Server-side optimisation (caching, hot-reload, etc. beyond the minimum to load markdown).
- Authoring tooling for new skills (Phase 1 is a one-way migration; new technique/resource authoring is rare and manual).

---

## 10. Decision gate before implementation

Before any implementation begins, the user is asked to confirm:

1. **The one-ontology mapping** — TOON skills → techniques (`ontology: workflow-canonical`, `kind: technique`, keeping their `Capability/Protocol/Rules/Errors` body shape); TOON/markdown resources → freeform resources (no `ontology`/`kind`). Flat, no nesting in Phase 1.
2. **The target structure** — `skills` orphan branch, `legacy/<workflow>/{techniques,resources}/<slug>/SKILL.md`, with the ontology definition at `shared/resources/workflow-canonical/SKILL.md`.
3. **The TOON-to-markdown mapping** (§5) — each top-level TOON field becomes a `##` section; nested objects become deeper headings.
4. **Resource reference rewriting** — numeric IDs become inline file-relative hyperlinks (from a technique to a sibling resource: `[slug](../../resources/<slug>/SKILL.md)`), placed at point-of-use; no `## Resources` section.
5. **The phase plan** (§6) — 9 sub-phases (1.0–1.8 plus 1.4b for workflow.toon path rewrites), with Phase 1.6 (parity validation) as the no-regression gate.
6. **The fidelity criteria** (§7) — content, behavioural, reference.
7. **The mandated removal** of legacy TOON skills and resources from the `workflows` branch in Phase 1.8 — single source of truth post-migration.
8. **The resolved decisions** (§8.1–§8.6) — `.toon`/`.md` resource handling, reference resolution (slug + numeric-ID fallback + path-rewrite), no migration-introduced ontology versioning, ontology definition at `shared/resources/workflow-canonical/`, flat-only Phase 1 content, migration tooling preserved + archived.

Once confirmed, implementation proceeds in workflow batches per Phase 1.4.
