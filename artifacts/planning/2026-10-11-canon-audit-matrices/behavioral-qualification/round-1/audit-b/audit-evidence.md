Snapshot: f98a133a20e1bd6037da00adc63aeb68f1bd0033c008c6bef050f7f02d793ecb

## Cell 588e9afc6de79e4e15622316

Row: corpus/qualification/activities/run.yaml#/id

Criterion: AP-02 — AP-02. broken-binding

Applicability: N — The activity id is run. AP-02 checks concrete activity routine argument-key sets and routine Outputs references resolved to technique output declarations. This row has neither contract endpoint nor a binding relationship; an identifier, graph label, ancestor constraint, or Markdown artifact mention is not such a binding.

Evaluation: finding — The concrete run/delivery invocation supplies {packet}, while deliver Inputs requires exactly {envelope}. There are no optional parameters or aliases and sealed is only an opaque value. This breaks the invocation signature structurally. The failing invocation is in the touched activity; every assigned row participates in this same argument-to-input comparison. The routine export report: emit.report resolves emit to produce, but the complete technique Outputs section declares only summary. report is absent. Markdown report mentions in Capability, Protocol, and Rules do not declare outputs. This is a structurally unresolved output binding. deliver is a closure consumer of the touched produce output contract, giving this defect diff attribution. The activity-to-routine, whole-routine, and complete execution rows expose both concrete binding contracts.

Evaluation: finding — The concrete run/delivery invocation supplies {packet}, while deliver Inputs requires exactly {envelope}. There are no optional parameters or aliases and sealed is only an opaque value. This breaks the invocation signature structurally. The failing invocation is in the touched activity; every assigned row participates in this same argument-to-input comparison. The routine export report: emit.report resolves emit to produce, but the complete technique Outputs section declares only summary. report is absent. Markdown report mentions in Capability, Protocol, and Rules do not declare outputs. This is a structurally unresolved output binding. deliver is a closure consumer of the touched produce output contract, giving this defect diff attribution. The activity-to-routine, whole-routine, and complete execution rows expose both concrete binding contracts.

Row: corpus/qualification/routines/deliver.yaml#@relationship/50a64427faa3df96

Criterion: DP-02 — 2. Provide a terminating workflow path

Applicability: N — The explicit qualification/run/delivery/deliver/emit relationship carries the concrete invocation, report export, and inherited destination. DP-02 is scoped to the workflow graph from initialActivity to a null destination. This activity, routine, technique, or local relationship supplies no workflow graph exit; the criterion explicitly states activity and routine steps do not add such exits.

Criterion: AP-02 — AP-02. broken-binding

Applicability: N — This leaf Capability sentence says Produce a report. AP-02 checks concrete activity routine argument-key sets and routine Outputs references resolved to technique output declarations. This row has neither contract endpoint nor a binding relationship; an identifier, graph label, ancestor constraint, or Markdown artifact mention is not such a binding.

Evaluation: finding — The captured call chain is qualification initial/graph run -> run activity delivery -> deliver routine emit -> produce. Its executing workflow ancestor qualification/techniques/TECHNIQUE.md requires archive; the leaf declares public. The values conflict at the touched leaf declaration. The ancestor states the required value and is not itself a conflicting leaf. The wrong destination propagates through the executing call chain.

Row: corpus/qualification/techniques/produce.md#/rules/line-11/clause-2

Criterion: AP-01 — AP-01. emission-without-validation

Applicability: A — This second Rules clause states: emit the report without validation. AP-01 applies to imperative Protocol instructions and Rules clauses concerning emission. This row contains such an instruction or clause, which must be tested separately even when it requires validation; a clean result does not make it inapplicable.

Evaluation: finding — The second semicolon-separated Rules clause says emit the report without validation. The first clause, Retain the report ID, is a legitimate retention constraint but does not excuse the separate emitting clause. The destination rule does not direct emission. The explicit validation bypass in the touched Rules instruction propagates to emitted reports.

Its reachable set is {run}; every exit returns to run and there is no null destination. Activity and routine steps add no exits in this dialect. The self-loop exception needs another reachable terminating path, which the complete source lacks. This makes workflow completion structurally impossible in the touched graph.

Its reachable set is {run}; every exit returns to run and there is no null destination. Activity and routine steps add no exits in this dialect.

Applicability: A — The done: run graph relationship returns to the run activity. DP-02 applies to the workflow path from initialActivity through graph exits. This graph or entry construct must be assessed against the complete workflow invariant, with all reachable exits considered; matching one activity name cannot establish termination.

Evaluation: finding — The complete workflow has initialActivity run and exactly one graph node and exit: run.done: run. Its reachable set is {run}; every exit returns to run and there is no null destination. Activity and routine steps add no exits in this dialect. The self-loop exception needs another reachable terminating path, which the complete source lacks. This makes workflow completion structurally impossible in the touched graph.

Criterion: DP-02 — 2. Provide a terminating workflow path

Applicability: A — The graph-entry relationship resolves the run activity. DP-02 applies to the workflow path from initialActivity through graph exits. This graph or entry construct must be assessed against the complete workflow invariant, with all reachable exits considered; matching one activity name cannot establish termination.

Evaluation: finding — The complete workflow has initialActivity run and exactly one graph node and exit: run.done: run. Its reachable set is {run}; every exit returns to run and there is no null destination. Activity and routine steps add no exits in this dialect. The self-loop exception needs another reachable terminating path, which the complete source lacks. This makes workflow completion structurally impossible in the touched graph.

Applicability: N — The graph-entry relationship identifies the run/done binding context. AP-01 scopes its Detect to imperative technique Protocol emission instructions and Rules emission clauses.
