### Assumptions Surfaced

| ID | Category | Risk | Assumption | Rationale |
|----|----------|------|------------|-----------|
| DP-1 | Problem Interpretation | M | The five augmentations are the complete set of changes needed to close the config-change defect class; no sixth gap is implied by the motivating incident | The issue enumerates exactly five gaps reconstructed from the real review, each with a distinct root cause |
| DP-2 | Problem Interpretation | L | The changes target workflow/technique definitions in the `workflows` worktree, not the TypeScript server source (`src/`, `schemas/`) | The review behaviour is authored as workflow state and per-activity conditions, not server code |
| DP-3 | Problem Interpretation | M | Each augmentation maps onto an identifiable existing review-mode activity/technique (rather than requiring a new activity) | Review mode already has activities covering ingest, structural review, severity, and validation |
| DP-4 | Complexity Assessment | L | The work is `complex` in breadth/coordination even though each augmentation is individually bounded, and codebase comprehension is required | Five cross-cutting changes across multiple activities plus harness coverage; classification confirmed at checkpoint |
| DP-5 | Workflow Path | L | A `skip-optional` path is sufficient — requirements are clear from the issue and the patterns are familiar, so elicitation and research add nothing; remaining risk is binding/placement | Issue is fully specified; path confirmed at the `workflow-path-selected` checkpoint |

### Reconciliation (autonomous code analysis)

Reconciliation ran without user interaction. Each assumption was classified by resolvability, code-resolvable ones were investigated against the workflow definitions, and convergence was reached with no stakeholder-dependent assumptions left open.

**DP-1 — Problem Interpretation — Not code-resolvable.**  
**Resolvability:** Stakeholder-scoped — whether five is the complete remedy set is a scope judgment, not a fact in the codebase.  
**Resolution:** Confirmed by the `classification-confirmed` checkpoint (problem and scope accepted).  

**DP-2 — Problem Interpretation — Code-resolvable.**  
**Resolvability:** Verifiable against the workflow definitions.  
**Evidence:** The `review-mode` guide states review mode is "plain workflow state" driven by the `is_review_mode` boolean, with behaviour expressed as standard `condition` clauses on steps/checkpoints/transitions in the `work-package` workflow definitions — not server source. Per-activity guidance lives in the workflow/technique layer.  
**Resolution:** Validated — changes belong in the `workflows` worktree definitions.  

**DP-3 — Problem Interpretation — Code-resolvable.**  
**Resolvability:** Verifiable by mapping each augmentation to an existing review activity.  
**Evidence:** The `review-mode` guide's per-activity section and adaptation table show owning activities for each gap: prior-feedback ingest and consolidated comments → `submit-for-review` / `post-impl-review`; config blast-radius and create/cleanup conservation → the structural comparison in `post-impl-review` / `strategic-review`; impact-based severity → the Severity Definitions table; reported-failure triage and multi-instance coverage → `validate` (documents failures as findings).  
**Resolution:** Validated — every augmentation has an identifiable host activity; no new activity is strictly required (final binding confirmed in comprehension).  

**DP-4 — Complexity Assessment — Not code-resolvable.**  
**Resolvability:** A judgment call about effort/coordination, not a code fact.  
**Resolution:** Confirmed by the `classification-confirmed` checkpoint (`complex`; `needs_comprehension` retained).  

**DP-5 — Workflow Path — Not code-resolvable.**  
**Resolvability:** A stakeholder decision about discovery scope.  
**Resolution:** Confirmed by the `workflow-path-selected` checkpoint (`skip-optional`; `needs_elicitation=false`, `needs_research=false`, `skip_optional_activities=true`).  

**Running counts:** total 5 — validated 2 (DP-2, DP-3), confirmed-by-checkpoint 3 (DP-1, DP-4, DP-5), invalidated 0, partially validated 0, open code-resolvable 0, open non-code-resolvable 0. Convergence reached; no open assumptions remain.

### User Response

**Review Status:** ✅ All Confirmed

**Feedback:**
- **DP-1:** Accepted via classification-confirmed checkpoint.
- **DP-4:** Accepted via classification-confirmed checkpoint.
- **DP-5:** Accepted via workflow-path-selected checkpoint (skip-optional).
