# Skills Interface Work Package

This folder contains planning artifacts for implementing a skills interface in workflow-server.

## Problem

Agents using workflow-server MCP tools lack structured guidance for tool selection and execution order, leading to inconsistent workflow execution.

## Solution

Implement a skills interface providing:
- Skill JSON with tool orchestration and workflow interpretation guidance
- MCP resources for skill discovery and loading
- IDE setup file for agent bootstrap
