# Ponytail Lean-Coding Workflow

> v1.0.0 — Drive a coding task, change, or codebase toward the leanest solution that still clears a non-negotiable safety floor, tracking every deliberate simplification as ponytail debt.

---

## Overview

Ponytail encodes the discipline of the lazy senior developer — lazy meaning *efficient*, not careless. The best code is the code that is never written, because every line that exists is a line to read, test, secure, and maintain. The workflow drives a change toward the leanest rung of [the ladder](resources/the-ladder.md#rungs) that still works, while holding a [safety floor](resources/the-ladder.md#safety-floor) that no shortcut may cross, and records each deliberate simplification as a [ponytail marker](resources/ponytail-marker-convention.md#convention) so the debt is tracked rather than forgotten.

**Use this workflow when you want to:**

- Build a change at the leanest rung that solves the real problem, not the imagined one
- Review a diff or a whole repo for over-engineering and quantify the cut
- Surface and track the deliberate simplifications already sitting in a codebase
- Get an honest accounting of the lean gain without fabricated savings numbers

The lazy lens has two dials. **Intensity** (`lite` / `full` / `ultra`) sets how aggressively a construct is flagged and how the code is built; **scope** (`change` / `repo`) sets whether the pass covers the diff or the whole tree. Setting either to its widest — `ultra` intensity or `repo` scope — adds the repo-wide audit.

## Adaptation notes (skill → workflow)

This workflow is adapted from the always-on Ponytail skill. Two divergences are intentional:

- **Invoked, not persistent.** The original skill is a per-response lens active on every reply until switched off. This workflow is invoked for a piece of work: intensity is selected once at intake and held for the pass, rather than persisting across a whole session.
- **Governs what is built, not how you talk.** The skill pairs with Caveman to also shape conversational style; that pairing is out of scope here. The `output-discipline` rule constrains only *unrequested* code-adjacent prose (design notes, feature tours) — not user-facing communication, and never the report artifacts the workflow's own techniques are asked to produce.

## Activities

| # | Activity | Description |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 01 | **Intake and Scope** (`intake-and-scope`) | Capture the task and target, set intensity and scope, and trace the real end-to-end flow before climbing |
| 02 | **Apply Ladder** (`apply-ladder`) | Climb to the minimal solution, mark deliberate simplifications, leave one runnable check, and clear the safety floor |
| 03 | **Over-Engineering Review** (`over-engineering-review`) | Tag the change's over-engineering one line per finding, closing with a net line-count scoreboard |
| 04 | **Repo Audit** (`repo-audit`) | Hunt repo-wide over-engineering biggest-cut-first (gated; `required: false`) |
| 05 | **Harvest Debt and Report** (`harvest-debt-and-report`) | Harvest ponytail markers into a debt ledger and append an honest gain scoreboard |

**Detailed documentation:** See [activities/README.md](activities/README.md) and the per-activity YAML definitions.

## Variables

| Variable | Type | Default | Required | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|----------|---------|
| `task_description` | string | — | yes | The coding task, change, or audit target to be made lean |
| `target_path` | string | `.` | no | Path to the code or repo under the lazy lens |
| `lazy_intensity` | string | `full` | no | `lite` / `full` / `ultra` — review depth; `ultra` gates in the repo audit |
| `pass_scope` | string | `change` | no | `change` (diff-scoped) or `repo` (whole-tree); `repo` gates in the repo audit |
| `safety_floor_cleared` | boolean | `false` | no | Set by the safety-floor checkpoint; gates the transition into review |
| `has_debt_markers` | boolean | `false` | no | Set during harvest; gates the gain-report tail |

## Techniques

The cross-cutting [`variable-binding`](../meta/techniques/variable-binding.md) technique is declared once at the workflow level and inherited by every activity. Every step binds one operation from the workflow-local `ponytail-operations` group.

`ponytail-operations` is an operation-group — a `TECHNIQUE.md` base contract plus one `<op>.md` file per operation — owning the lean-coding capability. The base contract holds the shared inputs (`task_description`, `target_path`, `lazy_intensity`, `pass_scope`) and rules (`output-discipline`, `take-higher-rung`, `deletion-over-addition`); every operation inherits them and is referenced qualified as `ponytail-operations::<op>`.

| Operation | Capability |
|-----------|------------|
| `ponytail-operations::scope-intake` | Capture and trace the change before a rung is chosen |
| `ponytail-operations::apply-ladder` | Climb to the minimal solution, mark ceilings, leave one check |
| `ponytail-operations::review-over-engineering` | Tag a change's over-engineering with a net-lines scoreboard |
| `ponytail-operations::audit-repo` | Hunt repo-wide over-engineering biggest-cut-first |
| `ponytail-operations::harvest-debt` | Harvest ponytail markers into a debt ledger |
| `ponytail-operations::report-gain` | Append an honesty-bounded gain scoreboard to the ledger |

`scope-intake` also binds the cross-workflow [`gitnexus-operations`](../meta/techniques/gitnexus-operations/TECHNIQUE.md) `query` / `context` operations for flow tracing when the codebase is indexed.

**Detailed documentation:** See [techniques/README.md](techniques/README.md) and [techniques/ponytail-operations/TECHNIQUE.md](techniques/ponytail-operations/TECHNIQUE.md).

## Resources

Four single-source reference files carry the discipline the operations apply:

| Resource | Owns |
|----------|------|
| [the-ladder.md](resources/the-ladder.md) | The understand-first trace, the seven rungs, and the safety floor |
| [review-taxonomy.md](resources/review-taxonomy.md) | The five over-engineering tags, the finding format, and the scoreboard |
| [ponytail-marker-convention.md](resources/ponytail-marker-convention.md) | The `ponytail: <ceiling>, add when <trigger>` marker convention and `no-trigger` flag |
| [honesty-boundary.md](resources/honesty-boundary.md) | The gain-reporting rule — benchmark medians only, never a fabricated per-repo figure |

**Detailed documentation:** See [resources/README.md](resources/README.md) for the catalog.
