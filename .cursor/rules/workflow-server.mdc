# Overview

For all workflow execution user requests use the workflow-server MCP server. Before use you *must*:
1. Fetch the `workflow-server://schemas` resource to load TOON schema definitions
2. Call the `get_rules` tool to load agent guidelines

CRITICAL: When following the workflow you *must* respect workflow fidelity as defined in the TOON files' semantics
